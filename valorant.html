It’s a 5v5 multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) where one team attacks and the other defends.
The main game mode,
Search and Destroy, is very similar to CS:GO. 
The attacking team’s goal is to plant a bomb (called a spike) 
and have it detonate, while the defending team tries to avoid that.
Regardless of whether the spike is planted or not,
if a squad is wiped out before any other victory condition is met, the opposing squad will win</font></p>

<p><font face="montserrant" style="font-size:17px;" color="White">Matches are 25 rounds long,
with each round lasting 100 seconds.
The first team to win 13 rounds wins the match overall.
At the beginning of the round, you’ll have 30 seconds to buy weapons and gear for that round. If you die in a round,
you’ll have to wait until the next round to respawn.
This main game mode can be played in either unrated or ranked matches.

<p><font face="montserrant" style="font-size:17px;" color="White">It sounds just like CS:GO’s Defuse game mode, but Riot has a twist on the formula.
In addition to buying weapons, you’ll also choose an Agent at the beginning of each round. Each Agent has an ability, ranging from healing allies to making walls appear out of nowhere.
Considering Valorant takes a MOBA-based approach to Agents, you’ll likely need a good spread of abilities if you want to win a match. Note, however, that you’ll need to buy some abilities at the beginning of a round.</font></p>

<p><font face="montserrant" style="font-size:17px;" color="White">Since launch, Valorant has added the Spike Rush game mode.
This is a quicker, best-of-seven-rounds mode where every attacker is equipped with a spike, and all players have the same weapon and all of their abilities; there is no buy round.
Valorant‘s seasons will be known as Acts,
each bringing new additions to the game including new Agents, maps, and modes.

<p><font face="montserrant" style="font-size:17px;" color="White">It seems we’ve finally reached the point where loot boxes aren’t par for the course with this type of free-to-play shooter. Riot Games confirmed that Valorant won’t have any loot boxes.
Players can purchase gun cosmetics — Agent cosmetics are still up in the air
but they’ll be distributed through a store, not through loot boxes. If you want to buy a bunch of skins at once, the store also has packs that bundle skins based around a central theme.

<p><font face="montserrant" style="font-size:17px;" color="White"> Valorant, like most other competitive shooters, has very low system specs. Any modern machine can tear through the game with 144+ fps, while older systems should still maintain a solid 60 fps.
We don’t know for sure what resolution or graphical quality the specs are based on, so you may have to lower your quality or resolution if you have an older system.
Here are the system requirements released by Riot Games.
